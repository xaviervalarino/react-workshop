My sample projects built while working through ["React Complete Guide"](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller

## Custom Hooks
[`./custom-hooks`](./custom-hooks)

A simple TODO list app that uses a custom HTTP to do CRUD operations on a Firebase Realtime Database.
(Moved away from CRA to Vite for compiling and it's night and day)
